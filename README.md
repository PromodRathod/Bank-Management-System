# Bank-Management-System
It is a simple C++ Bank Management System which has features of performing simple and basic tasks that a banking app must provided.
It is full command based, I have used files for the backend to store, retrieve data and even perform operations. This code can easily be modified and converted to C program because the source code is actually written in the style of C Program and does not follow the object oriented programming fundamental so it is really easy to run as both C++ and C program. It can be further upgraded for better functionality.
